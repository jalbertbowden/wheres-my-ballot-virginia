**Where's My Ballot, Virginia?** uses the [Google Civic Information API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/) to find elections and voting information based off user inputted address information. It also uses the [Census' Geocoder API](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/) in connection with [Leaflet.js](https://leafletjs.com/) to return relevant geographic layers for the user input. [formalize.css](https://formalize.me/) has been butchered to provide a base form control style.
